# CodexMonitor Cursor Rules (minimal)

- Read root AGENTS.md first, then lazy-load module docs.
- Prefer reuse over creating duplicate utilities/components.
- Keep frontend logic in hooks/services, keep components presentational.
- Route Tauri IPC through src/services/tauri.ts only.
- Keep shared backend logic in src-tauri/src/shared/* and adapters thin.
- Never commit real secrets or runtime .env files.
